# NeuralNetwork
I'm pretty sure this qualifies as a Neural Network, but if it doesn't, call it a 'thing for generating english-like sentences'

The IDE used is Code::Blocks, compiles with GCC 4.9.2 TDM
No other dependencies aside from the C++ standard library
(Although you do need the assets folder to be placed in the same directory as the executable)
